The sonographer reports a negative sonographic Murphy's sign.\nCommon Bile Duct: Measures up to 5 mm diameter. No filling defects are seen.\nSpleen: The spleen measures 12.2 cm in length. Contours are normal, negative for mass.\nPancreas: Head and body are normal. The tail is shadowed out by overlying bowel gas.\nRight Kidney: Measures 12 centimeters in length. Normal cortical thickness and echotexture with no hydronephrosis.\nLeft Kidney: Measures 12.4 centimeters in length. Normal cortical thickness and echotexture with no hydronephrosis.\nThere are at least 3 echogenic rounded structures are seen in each kidney which correspond to findings on the CT exam 9/9/2024.  The largest seen measures up to 1.6 cm diameter on today's exam.  Fluid/fluid levels are present in some if not all of these structures.\nAscites: None.\nAorta: Normal caliber and patency.\nIVC: Normal caliber and patency.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  There are at least 3 echogenic rounded structures are seen in each kidney which correspond to findings on the CT exam 9/9/2024. The largest seen measures up to 1.6 cm diameter on today's exam. Fluid/fluid levels are present in some if not all of these structures. These are favored to represent hemorrhagic cysts. Recommend follow-up ultrasound in 6 months to ensure stability.\n2.  Wedge-shaped areas of relatively higher echogenicity throughout the liver which correspond to the areas that were hypodense on the CT exam 9/9/2024. These are favored to represent areas of fatty infiltration.\n3.  Otherwise unremarkable abdominal ultrasound.\n\nElectronically signed by John Doe, on 9/11/2024 9:02 AM\n"}
